# Diabetes Prediction Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors) for predicting diabetes using the Diabetes dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Overview

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease, and accurate prediction of diabetes risk can aid in early diagnosis and intervention. This project explores the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting diabetes based on physiological parameters.
